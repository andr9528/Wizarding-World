<h2 id="season-1">Season 1</h2>
<h3 id="plot">Plot</h3>
<p>Digging around in Egypt, in the old tombs of the Pharaohs, An Ancient artifact is found, but unknown to our heroes, a curse has been captured within the artifact and is released on their touche, beginning to spread among them, without their knowledge of it happening.</p>
<p>After days of deciphering the ancient hieroglyphs, the presence of the curse of reveled to them. From the hieroglyphs, they gather that the curse spread among people just by close proximity, quite rapidly, causing muggles to develop magical powers, albeit uncontrollable ones (much like children of wizards/witches), and witches and wizards to begin lose control of their magic.</p>
<p>Some of the good news for our archaeologists does include that the curse takes time to complete take hold of its victims, meaning witches and wizards can still use their magic for and extended period of time, before beginning to lose control. Another good news for our heroes is that a potion was created to counter the curse, but the four ingredients have long been lost to society so our heroes have to uncover where they are and gather them, for the potion before all witches and wizards lose control of their magic.</p>
<p>Each of the four ingredients have a close relation to one of the four elements of the world, and are found in terrain that matches that element</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire 		-&gt; The dunes of the Sahara Desert</li>
<li>Water 	-&gt; The rain forests of the Amazon</li>
<li>Air 		-&gt; The slopes of Mount Everest</li>
<li>Earth 	-&gt; The underground caverns of Crystals in Mexico</li>
</ul>
<p>To get the ingredient our archaeologists has to first figure out where they are, then get there, which proves more and more difficult the further along the curse is, and then finally get past a last test. There are four ingredient, much like there are four houses in Hogwarts, and so each test requires the expertise of one of the four houses, making it invaluable that there are exactly one from each house on the team of archaeologists.</p>

<p>Muggles believe the Pharaohs was ancient kings of Egypt, who could commune with the gods, when in reality they where wizards.</p>
<h2 id="season-2">Season 2</h2>
<h3 id="plot-1">Plot</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the curse, the statue of secrecy is ruined, as no plausible solution is found in time, to resolve the fact that every muggle knows that magic is real, due to them experiencing it them self. So to try and save the world from another world war, the ministry steps in, to try and calm the population of both the magical and muggle world, as new ways of living has to be develop quickly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile our archaeologists gets tasked with recovering the reason for the creation of the curse, along with uncovering how the aftermath was handled, last time the curse was released. They are tasked with this in an attempt to aid ministry in regaining control over the situation that is quickly spinning out of control.</p>
<h3 id="lore-1">Lore</h3>
<p>The curse was originally made in a period where witches and wizards was almost completely extinct, in an attempt to create more witches and wizards from muggles, but backfired. The magic that the muggles got, was then named ‘Chaos Magic’, due to it being completely uncontrollable, no matter how much training the individuals got. Whats worse was that the magic fully grown witches and wizard, infected by curse, also started to transform into ‘Chaos Magic’.</p>
<p>‘Chaos Magic’ at its worst, could cause a simple Alohomora, to turn into something like Bombarda Maxima. Casting a spell while under the effect of the curse can cause a number of things, but most commonly the spell will just go a bit off course</p>
<h3 id="cameos">Cameos</h3>
<p>During scenes in the ministry, there could possibly be cameos of Harry, Ron and Hermione, much old of course, but in should in theory be working in the ministry, so would be a fun little detail.</p>
